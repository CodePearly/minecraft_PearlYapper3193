The intent of Sky Grid is kept in this pack by having players adventure into the grid to collect resources to further progress. Instead of replacing resource generation, mods are added to give more depth to the experience. From tech mods to magic, there is sure to be plenty for any Minecraft player while providing a unique environment.\r\n\r\nThe modpack is created with a custom Sky Grid mod that allows the Overworld, Nether, and End to be grids. Each dimension has been meticulously designed to give the player access to every necessary resource while presenting almost every block available. Instead of the typical dragon fight, you must begin the fight in a brand new way by finding a dragon egg in the End dimension. \r\n\r\nDark Grid promises to keep the nostalgic feel of the original Sky Grid while breathing new life with exciting new mods and progression. The grid offers loot chests, mob spawners, ores, and countless other blocks needed to turn your single block into a massive fortress.

by Kehaan\r\n\r\nThis modpack is centered around the genre of games that Stardew Valley and Harvest Moon are in.\r\nBasically, instead of the typical grind in MC, you here have to build and maintain a farm/small town in order to be able to progress. Your first goal will be to spawn in a Goddess, who will explain how to progress in the pack. Here you will slowly build up a small town, have huge farms, sell your crops, gain money and progress further. There are 4 seasons, each of which have special crops to buy, plant, and then harvest. A huge part of this pack is selling your goods, at local NPCs, to get money, that you can then use to progress either further with your village, or even buy parts from other mods to progress in those. In this pack, there are many parts, you can\u2019t craft, instead you have to buy them with your hard earned money. This pack also features some small twists along the way, like hydration. You will also find an achievement book, that gives you some long-term goals.\r\n\r\nWARNING: THIS MODPACK DOESN'T SUPPORT REMOVING MODS\r\n\r\nKehaans Blog: http://kehaan.me/ \r\n\r\nPack Art made by: https://twitter.com/hub3rt \r\n\r\nMenu music from Stardew Valley, with permission from: https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe - Proof Here: http://imgur.com/a/y1HXd\r\n\r\nIf you record/stream this pack, please leave a link back to this page and or my twitter.","supportURL":"http://kehaan.me/","websiteURL":"http://kehaan.me/"},{"id":440,"position":105,"name":"Colossal Sorcery","type":"public","devVersions":[{"version":"Colossal-Sorcery-1.12.1","minecraft":"1.12.2","hash":"d6625e93bebb3b681c4bb8553b9abf08","hasLoader":true},{"version":"Colossal-Sorcery-1.1.8.5","minecraft":"1.7.10","hash":"5f342dbd3b6300cc99be3e1039e62c68"},{"version":"Colossal-Sorcery-1.1.8.1","minecraft":"1.7.10","hash":"2e4412d36d5e75221b2fc3741411e2e3"}],"versions":[{"version":"1.12.1","minecraft":"1.12.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":true,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"1.1.8.5","minecraft":"1.7.10","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":true},{"version":"1.1.8.1","minecraft":"1.7.10","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false}],"createServer":true,"logging":true,"featured":false,"hasDiscordImage":false,"description":"A magically themed modpack that introduces the magic in a subtle yet beautiful environment - The modpack uses Alternate terrain generator and streams to produce a realistic and stunning landscape, Thaumcraft, Ar's magicka, Witchery and Botania form the main magical components of the modpack.

Highly inspired by TerraFirmaCraft, it offers a revamped tech tree and new game mechanics.\r\n\r\nFocusing initially on wilderness survival, you will progress to mechanical energy for early automation and ultimately learn to harness electrical energy.  Different tiers of metals are scattered through the world, and may require unique methods to obtain.\r\n\r\nAn optional quest book is provided to explain gameplay changes, and to nudge the player in the right direction if they're stuck.\r\n\r\nHomestead offers unique mod interactions so the pack feels more cohesive, and less like a \"kitchen sink\".  A custom nutrition system was also written to encourage dietary variety in a realistic setting.\r\n\r\nThis is a difficult pack, and experience with modded Minecraft is suggested.  There are very few \"magic blocks\"; instead you are provided the tools to assemble and automate your own creations.\r\n\r\nHomestead was designed to work as a base for new survival-focused packs.  It remains compatible with much of the existing mod ecosystem, and dropping in new mods should work without requiring configuration.  Of course, this will affect game balance.\r\n\r\nExisting worlds will not automatically receive quest changes on pack updates.  On clients, you can run \"/bq_admin default load\" to update existing worlds.  On servers, please copy the file /config/betterquesting/DefaultQuests.json over /world/betterquesting/QuestDatabase.json.\r\n\r\nScreenshots and source files for Homestead are available on GitHub.

This pack focuses on providing the player a long term progression experience with purpose. SevTech introduces a number of mechanics never before done such as: hiding ore until unlocked, dynamically hidden items and recipes based on progress, new mobs appear as you progress further and much more! The modpack uses the vanilla advancement system to guide the player along while still allowing an open, sandbox experience. As you progress through the hundreds of custom advancements you will unlock new \"ages\" which will show you new mods to work through. \r\n\r\nSevTech aims to introduce many mods not frequently used while altering some more widely known mods. The pack also features a ton of custom mods for the best player experience. \r\n\r\nYou'll start your first world with nothing. No map or HWYLA and only a handful of items and recipes. As you progress, you will unlock those features, thousands of items and blocks, and much more. Your goal is to follow through the advancement system from the stone age all the way into space!\r\n\r\nEvery feature in SevTech: Ages can be done in Multiplayer, too! Every progression point is player based and not server based. This means you can play on a large server and not be left behind if you start after every one else. The pack also provides the mod \"Together Forever\" to let players form teams and sync progression.\u00a0The World Type is suggested to be \"quark_realistic\".\r\n\r\nNote: This pack will continue to add content after its initial release. The aim of these updates will be to provide a prestige system, more advancements, extra end-game content, and bug fixes. We will do everything in our power to make sure no update will corrupt worlds and a transition into a new update is as smooth as possible.","discordInviteURL":"https://discord.gg/WqCUbaE","supportURL":"https://github.com/Darkosto/SevTech-Ages/issues","websiteURL":"http://twitch.tv/darkosto"},{"id":470,"position":110,"name":"Too Much of Everything","type":"public","devVersions":[{"version":"TMOE-1.4.1a","minecraft":"1.10.2","hash":"7753988c46541765671361870acaf372"},{"version":"TMOE-1.4.1","minecraft":"1.10.2","hash":"42d49172486264969fe9c1a4d4cd7fdb"},{"version":"TMOE-1.4.0","minecraft":"1.10.2","hash":"ead8a178aeca52babc2493cdc4aa82c9"},{"version":"TMOE-1.3.5","minecraft":"1.10.2","hash":"1468a96a8f9d579b2dcf6667de65df43"},{"version":"TMOE-1.3.4","minecraft":"1.10.2","hash":"0b78cf02b17c1f6d318418e7bcc89e35"},{"version":"TMOE-1.3.3","minecraft":"1.10.2","hash":"e19e4c2ac59c3bc93703aa3968444c69"},{"version":"TMOE-1.3.2","minecraft":"1.10.2","hash":"a0093681f5771ff7d1ee72728ad891c1"},{"version":"TMOE-1.3.1","minecraft":"1.10.2","hash":"899fa27576079590407d870fb5619854"},{"version":"TMOE-1.3.0","minecraft":"1.10.2","hash":"c6c7074f85450aca6c770bc94a2d948f"},{"version":"TMOE-1.1.2","minecraft":"1.10.2","hash":"70cceca8b161d7ee1bb10fdc26fd93f4"},{"version":"TMOE-1.2.0","minecraft":"1.10.2","hash":"e8dd925ed2274a4c92ebcaab8851b07d"},{"version":"TMOE-1.1.1","minecraft":"1.10.2","hash":"14d03267d83734fe03cfd0910469900a"},{"version":"TMOE-1.1.0","minecraft":"1.10.2","hash":"2dd585828b814e52b6827b79b9095564"},{"version":"TMOE-1.0.1","minecraft":"1.10.2","hash":"aa1c4bf243627180942b8ef733051b72"},{"version":"TMOE-1.0.0","minecraft":"1.10.2","hash":"31cd51db9679cff2a91ea8f78771f4a1"}],"versions":[{"version":"1.4.1a","minecraft":"1.10.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":true},{"version":"1.4.1","minecraft":"1.10.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":true},{"version":"1.4.0","minecraft":"1.10.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":true},{"version":"1.3.5","minecraft":"1.10.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":true},{"version":"1.3.4","minecraft":"1.10.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":true},{"version":"1.3.3","minecraft":"1.10.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":true},{"version":"1.3.2","minecraft":"1.10.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":true},{"version":"1.3.1","minecraft":"1.10.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":true},{"version":"1.3.0","minecraft":"1.10.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":true},{"version":"1.2.0","minecraft":"1.10.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":true},{"version":"1.1.2","minecraft":"1.10.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":true},{"version":"1.1.1","minecraft":"1.10.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":true},{"version":"1.1.0","minecraft":"1.10.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":true},{"version":"1.0.1","minecraft":"1.10.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":true},{"version":"1.0.0","minecraft":"1.10.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":true}],"createServer":true,"logging":true,"featured":false,"hasDiscordImage":false,"description":"Welcome to Too Much of Everything!\r\n\r\nTMOE is one of the largest and most diverse Minecraft 1.10.2 packs currently available, and as such, provides some mods for everyone, and every play style!

However... the horrors to come as you delve deeper into the mods and what lurks below everything will be your hardest challenge yet.\r\n\r\nWelcome Experts. This will be one long road for you.

SkyFactory 4 offers a brand-new experience never before seen in the series. Full automation, tech, magic, and bacon resources! This iteration offers over 30+ world types so you can play the pack like never before! While some world types are based on the classic tree on dirt others are designed with unique recipes and advancements.\r\n\r\nWhat makes this version different from every other SkyFactory before it? We've completely redesigned the resource gathering. Sieving for resources are a thing of the past. For a more immersive experience, Sky Orchards has been introduced. Resource Trees provides a built-in progression system and lets the player choose the resources they want to produce rather than a randomized system. We've removed the achievement book and replaced it with the advancement system. Instead of requiring players to manually check out what they've accomplished, the game will keep track for you. This system isn't designed to create a required questing system, but rather an optional set of goals for players looking for ideas on what to do next.\r\n\r\nSkyFactory 4 introduces the prestige system! This is a completely optional game mode allowing you to unlock mods, items, and mechanics through an open progression system. Prestige points and unlocks are global and can be brought with you to other worlds! Prestige points can be gained by finishing advancements or by using the Parabox, a time traveling box that generates points. To get started, enable prestige mode on the world creation screen.\r\n\r\nBeyond this initial release, we are planning regular content updates outside of bug fixes.

Well this is the correct pack for you. This is a modpack created by Arsenal Network and this pack was highly requested to be created. This pack has an amazing world generation with tons and tons of biomes to explore and dungeons, ships, abandoned homes, and villages to loot. When you first start on the pack you begin with some starting items that are helpful for your adventure for the day and night. But beware the night is not so friendly as it sounds like. Some pretty creepy looking mobs might jump or crawl at you. While you are at it don't be afraid to kill any enemies because they drop some serious good loot if you are lucky. This pack is going to have a quest system which is going to be created on the Better Questing mod. The questing book is still blank and is a WIP. This pack also includes a mod were it gives you a death compass if you have died and tells you exactly how to get to your death location and gives you the exact cords to it. The goal of this pack is to explore all the new areas that have been added and to fight the harder mobs for legendary loot. Well.... that's all I've got to tell you about this pack as I will leave the rest of the adventure up to you to discover.\r\n\r\n \r\nRecommended allocated RAM/Memory: 3-4 GB\r\nWhile you are at it please make sure you have 64 bit java 8 installed.

This version of the pack is a lot easier to run for older/not strong pc's. However the main features from the main pack is still in. This Lite version, was under different test able to run with as little as 1 GB ram, and having atleast 100-150 MORE FPS than the main pack.\r\nIf you have a newer/stronger PC, then install \"Farming Valley\", and i would recommend trying that pack out first to see how your pc run it. And if there is issues, then run this version of the pack instead.\r\n\r\nIf you don't know Farming Valley then the description from the main pack fits this on as well:\r\nThis modpack is centered around the genre of games that Stardew Valley and Harvest Moon are in.\r\nBasically, instead of the typical grind in MC, you here have to build and maintain a farm/small town in order to be able to progress. Your first goal will be to spawn in a Goddess, who will explain how to progress in the pack. Here you will slowly build up a small town, have huge farms, sell your crops, gain money and progress further. There are 4 seasons, each of which have special crops to buy, plant, and then harvest. A huge part of this pack is selling your goods, at local NPCs, to get money, that you can then use to progress either further with your village, or even buy parts from other mods to progress in those. In this pack, there are many parts, you can\u2019t craft, instead you have to buy them with your hard earned money. This pack also features some small twists along the way. You will also find an achievement book, that gives you some long-term goals.\r\n\r\nWARNING: THIS MODPACK DOESN'T SUPPORT REMOVING MODS\r\n\r\nKehaans Blog: http://kehaan.me/ \r\n\r\nPack Art made by: https://twitter.com/hub3rt \r\n\r\nMenu music from Stardew Valley, with permission from: https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe - Proof Here: http://imgur.com/a/y1HXd\r\n\r\nIf you record/stream this pack, please leave a link back to this page and or my twitter.","supportURL":"http://kehaan.me/","websiteURL":"http://kehaan.me/"},{"id":526,"position":155,"name":"Mystic's Cubic Chunks Modpack","type":"public","devVersions":[{"version":"dev-12.7.0-11.6.2020","minecraft":"1.12.2","hash":"9fc33512c6cea3ce8d9e4bc92e0f0f39","hasLoader":true}],"versions":[{"version":"14.2.7","minecraft":"1.12.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":true,"hasLoader":true}],"createServer":true,"logging":true,"featured":false,"hasDiscordImage":false,"description":"Build as high or low as you want, add colored lights to your builds, and explore deep dungeons all in this modpack. \r\n\r\nHyper Lighting is in a dev build version if a bug is spotted report it to me and here --> https://github.com/hypherionmc/hyperlighting_public/issues\r\n\r\nThe version of Terra 1:1 that is used comes from the Build The Earth Discord Server with Permission under MIT License and a conversation https://imgur.com/a/Xg9PT9I .

This Mod pack is a collection of mods that help build the setting of the Last Days world. Living in the wastes is a constant battle for survival.  Work together in settlements or compete against rival survivors for resources. Last Days is well known for its roleplay aspect. Don't forget to turn on the Last Days language pack.  (Textures and the Language pack are a WIP.)\r\n \r\nLore- A post-WWII inventor named Mr. History once made a fortune off of his android robot toy(The Hugatron). With his new-found fortune he built a company called Orbital Industries that soon fulfilled every need and want of the world. \r\nBut, with prosperity there also came over production and the consequence of the world\u2019s resources being depleted severely; the surface quickly became covered in waste and unneeded overstock. Soon, it was found that the moon also had bountiful resources ripe for extraction. \r\nHaving leaped forward unto the moon, Mr. History\u2019s company, Orbital Industries(O.I.), yet again began its mass-production. Digging deep, these mines, nicknamed the belly, were later turned into laboratories, factories, and storage for the waste and other mass-produced products.\r\nThe countries of Earth, with the fortunes they amassed from selling all their resources to O.I., also began stockpiling weapons of all kinds produced by O.I.. \r\nOne fateful day, Mr. History's lead scientist, Dr. Crocopolous, performed an experiment that left the world in fear. From the Earth, people looked to the sky and saw the moon crumbling to pieces; this day is known as the start of The Event. \r\nOver the course of seven years, the countries of the world prepared for Doomsday as the debris from the moon fell deeper into the gravity well of Earth. Once the first lunar debris began its descent unto the world, a single malfunctioning early-warning missile alert system inadvertently triggered the launch of an I.C.B.M; this caused all other countries to launch their own ICBMs inevitably leading to the cascading destruction of the world.\r\nOver the next few years, the debris raining from the moon slowly waned in severity and what was left of humanity began leaving the H.I.V.E.s (built by the apologetic O.I.) for their own settlements they began to construct. Several Centuries have since passed since the time known as The Event... \r\n\r\nWho are you in this wasteland; who will you become?","discordInviteURL":"https://discord.gg/4hccsbP","supportURL":"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/the-last-days-modpack","websiteURL":"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/the-last-days-modpack"},{"id":529,"position":106,"name":"Colony: Lost in Deep Space","type":"public","devVersions":[{"version":"DEV","minecraft":"1.12.2","hash":"a048bb6634b4ebdc42a3ace862c7deba","hasLoader":true}],"versions":[{"version":"2.3.5r","minecraft":"1.12.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":true,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"2.3.4r","minecraft":"1.12.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"2.3.3r","minecraft":"1.12.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"2.3.2r","minecraft":"1.12.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"2.3.1r","minecraft":"1.12.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"2.3r","minecraft":"1.12.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"2.2r","minecraft":"1.12.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"2.1.2r","minecraft":"1.12.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"2.1.1r","minecraft":"1.12.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"2.1r","minecraft":"1.12.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"2.0.5.2r","minecraft":"1.12.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"2.0.5.1r","minecraft":"1.12.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"2.0.4r","minecraft":"1.12.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"2.0.3r","minecraft":"1.12.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"2.0.2r","minecraft":"1.12.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"2.0.1r","minecraft":"1.12.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"2.0r","minecraft":"1.12.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"0.1.9.1r","minecraft":"1.12.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"0.1.9r","minecraft":"1.12.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"0.1.8r","minecraft":"1.12.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"0.1.7.1r","minecraft":"1.12.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"0.1.7r","minecraft":"1.12.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"0.1.6.2r","minecraft":"1.12.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true}],"createServer":true,"logging":true,"featured":false,"hasDiscordImage":false,"description":"Welcome to Colony: Lost in Deep Space\r\n\r\nAs you embark on your journey, you find yourself in a dire situation - you have crash landed on a distant planet after your spaceship was attacked. Stranded and alone, your ultimate goal is to return to your home planet. However, before you can do that, there are several obstacles you must overcome.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, you will need to establish a base of operations. You cannot travel through the vastness of space without proper infrastructure, so it is crucial that you find a suitable location and build a sturdy base. You will need to gather resources such as food, water, and building materials to ensure your survival and create a functional base.\r\n\r\nOnce you have established a base, it is time to focus on the main objective - building a new spaceship. This will not be an easy task as you will need to gather rare and valuable resources scattered across the planet. You will have to venture into unknown territories, battle hostile creatures, and overcome difficult challenges to obtain the necessary materials.\r\n\r\nAs you progress through the game, you will encounter various characters, both friendly and hostile, who may be able to assist or hinder your journey. You will have to make strategic decisions and choose your allies carefully to ensure your survival.\r\n\r\nIn summary, Colony: Lost in Deep Space is a challenging and exciting adventure game that will test your skills and perseverance. You must establish a base, gather resources, and build a new spaceship to return home.

If you do not like anime, please do not rant towards me.\r\n\r\nUnlike other modpacks, this modpack uses some strange and/or unpopular/underrated mods to enhance the experience, such as Chromaticraft and Shincolle. It also never uses certain popular mods, such as Minetweaker. Ore generation is also tweaked - instead of having all these infuriatingly similar ores and having to stack each same type from different mods, we only generate one kind - from one mod only. Thermal Foundation is prioritized, and other mods that add their own ores that are considered \"priority\" are enabled.\r\n\r\nExploration is enforced because of the main mod Chromaticraft's focus being... well, exploration.\r\n\r\nAlong with the above, some mods from future versions are also added, for plot purposes.\r\n\r\nYou may have noted that this is 1.7.10 and not the usual 1.12.2 or 1.16.5 or alike. Think of it as a time machine - back when modding was at its most popular. Along with this, some mods are only available on 1.7.10, and their creators, if they are still active, have also most likely stated that they wish to not update to modern versions until they have enough time. (The most likely outcome is that they will start porting to modern versions when Minecraft reaches its EOL, which is highly unlikely.)\r\n\r\nFor your convenience, 1.16.5 textures have been applied to everything. This will eventually be downloadable as a separate resource pack.\r\n\r\nThink of it as a \"fever dream,\" but with Minecraft mods, and *cough* consistent crashing when attempting to autocraft with AE2. *cough*\r\n\r\nThis pack is still in its development stage and will not be finished anytime soon (as of March 2021).\r\n\r\nCover art is by me.\r\n\r\nThis pack contains Fastcraft, by Player, enabled by default. Fastcraft enhances Minecraft with increased performance. Bug reports being made directly to mod authors should state that Fastcraft is enabled.

If you have any suggestions for mods to add or for changes to the config, feel free to hop into the discord server by clicking on the little \u201cDiscord\u201d button on the modpack.\r\n\r\nArt once again done by There are Bees in My Mouth","discordInviteURL":"https://discord.gg/HWNSWWf3Ep","websiteURL":"https://a-god.agentmaxwell.repl.co/lc1.12/"},{"id":571,"position":139,"name":"Danger in The Cliffs","type":"public","devVersions":[],"versions":[],"createServer":true,"logging":true,"featured":false,"hasDiscordImage":false,"description":null},{"id":572,"position":8,"name":"Kingdoms Of The Valley","type":"public","devVersions":[{"version":"dev","minecraft":"1.19.2","hash":"8d4ab28377c2182cc97adf80cfc48a7b","hasLoader":true}],"versions":[{"version":"v3.0.1","minecraft":"1.19.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":true,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"v3.0","minecraft":"1.19.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":true,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"v2.0.6","minecraft":"1.18.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"v2.0.5","minecraft":"1.18.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"v2.0.4","minecraft":"1.18.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"v2.0.3","minecraft":"1.18.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"v2.0.2","minecraft":"1.18.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"v2.0.1","minecraft":"1.18.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"v2.0","minecraft":"1.18.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"1.9","minecraft":"1.16.5","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":true,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"1.8","minecraft":"1.16.5","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"1.7.1-B8","minecraft":"1.16.5","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"1.7-B8","minecraft":"1.16.5","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"1.6-B7","minecraft":"1.16.5","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"1.5.1-B6","minecraft":"1.16.5","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"1.5-B6","minecraft":"1.16.5","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"1.4-B5","minecraft":"1.16.5","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"1.16.1.3.Beta4","minecraft":"1.16.5","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":false,"hasLoader":true}],"createServer":true,"logging":true,"featured":false,"hasDiscordImage":false,"description":"Welcome to Kingdoms of the Valley!

However, if it causes an older mod in the modpack to malfunction, the version that is currently included with the modpack is forge-43.4.13jar.\r\n\r\nFORGE 1.18.2:  The latest version of Forge for 1.18.2 should work, but in the case, it breaks an older mod in this modpack, the version I have currently packaged with the modpack is forge-40.2.21.jar \r\n\r\nOPTIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS:\r\n\r\nI'd personally recommend the use of [Optifine](https://optifine.net/downloads) (note: for 1.18.2 or newer, Optifine isn't compatible out of the box).

The modpack can be played either solo or with friends, but the ultimate goal is to survive as long as possible.\r\n\r\nThe modpack includes a variety of vanilla-like mobs, both passive and hostile, that will try to kill the player. These mobs are much stronger than their vanilla counterparts, so players must be cautious and strategic when engaging with them. Additionally, the modpack features unique biomes, structures, and items to enhance the gameplay experience.\r\n\r\nIf the player dies three times, they will be put into spectator mode until they create a new world. This means that the player will not be able to interact with the world and must watch from a distance. This penalty adds a new level of difficulty to the game, making it more challenging for players to survive.\r\n\r\nOverall, \"3RD LIFE\" is a challenging and exciting Minecraft modpack that offers a unique and thrilling gameplay experience for players. Whether playing alone or with friends, surviving with only three lives is a true test of skill and strategy.\r\n\r\nThis pack includes many of the popular mods for 1.16.5, here are some of the mods:\r\n\r\n3RD LIFE\r\nYUNG's Mods\r\nMacaw's Mods\r\nChisel\r\nFarmer's Delight\r\nIron Chests\r\nJust Enough Items\r\nMowzie's Mobs\r\nNetherite Horse Armor\r\nBiomes O Plenty\r\nAether\r\nTwilight Forest\r\n\r\nYou can find a full list of mods used in this pack over at our technic page.\r\n\r\nSETUP & INSTALLATION\r\n\r\nFORGE:  The latest version of Forge for 1.20.1 should work, but in the case it breaks an older mod in this modpack, the version I have currently packaged with the modpack is forge-47.3.11.jar \r\n\r\nOPTIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS: \r\n\r\nI'd personally recommend the use of Optifine (https://optifine.net/downloads) (make sure for either 1.16.5 or 1.20.1 depending on what version you are using) and some shaders if your system can handle them to bring out the best with this modpack and Minecraft.\r\n\r\nSponsored by BisectHosting \r\nhttps://bisecthosting.com/AMPZ\r\n\r\nDon't forget at the checkout use my promo code \"AMPZ' to receive a 25% discount on your first month when buying any of their gaming services!","discordInviteURL":"https://discord.ampznetwork.com","supportURL":"https://github.com/AMPZNetwork/3RD-LIFE","websiteURL":"https://www.ampznetwork.com"},{"id":577,"position":137,"name":"Steve's New Galaxy","type":"public","devVersions":[],"versions":[],"createServer":true,"logging":true,"featured":false,"hasDiscordImage":false,"description":null},{"id":578,"position":112,"name":"Attack of The Ender","type":"public","devVersions":[{"version":"V3_0_1_r","minecraft":"1.16.5","hash":"963d9b4410aa7e24b5bf3eb6e9c44795","hasLoader":true},{"version":"V3_0_r","minecraft":"1.16.5","hash":"5791d73be948eb624bb0ffb7adaf653c","hasLoader":true},{"version":"V_2_2_r","minecraft":"1.12.2","hash":"e09a0dd0d7af3811d967f7c34f8f10b4","hasLoader":true}],"versions":[{"version":"v3.0.1r","minecraft":"1.16.5","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":true,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"v3.0r","minecraft":"1.16.5","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":true,"hasLoader":true},{"version":"v2.2r","minecraft":"1.12.2","canUpdate":true,"isRecommended":true,"hasLoader":true}],"createServer":true,"logging":true,"featured":false,"hasDiscordImage":false,"description":"\u26a0\ufe0fThis pack has been discounted \u26a0\ufe0f\r\n\r\nAre you a seasoned Minecraft player looking to shake things up and try something new?

Zombies lurk around every corner, and as night falls, they become more aggressive and deadly. During a bloodmoon, players will face swarms of undead that will stop at nothing to take them down. Surviving in this harsh and unforgiving environment requires strategy, skill, and a bit of luck.\r\n\r\nOne of the unique aspects of Dead Light Z is the crafting system. Players can craft a wide variety of weapons, tools, and other items to help them survive. The modpack also includes a variety of new materials, such as irradiated metal, that can be used to craft powerful weapons and armor. In addition to crafting, players can also build their own bases to help protect themselves from the zombie hordes.\r\n\r\nOverall, Dead Light Z is an intense and thrilling modpack that will put players' survival skills to the test.

It seems so familiar, somehow, but then a massive meteor screams through the sky overhead. Welcome to Rotary Skies!\r\n\r\nRotary Skies is the authorized Rotarycraft-centered Skyblock modpack. The start seems similar enough, but as soon as you get steel, a whole world of engines, gearboxes, grinders, pumps, and centrifuges opens up!\r\n\r\nWork through over eighty quests as you go from cobblestone generators to fusion reactors! The quests guide you but don\u2019t hold your hand. They\u2019ll tell you what you need to do next, but not exactly how. In Rotary Skies, the \u201chow\u201d is the fun part!\r\n\r\nThere is no sieving in this modpack! What are you, some kind of caveman? No, until our liquefaction machines and centrifuges are up and running, we hunt for ores in the nether, like men (or other strong, mighty genders)!\r\n\r\nWe also keep bees, and by \u201ckeep bees\u201d I mean selectively-breed and genetically-modify bees in our quest for the uberbiene: the ultimate bee! We\u2019ve also got trains and stuff, so that\u2019s cool.\r\n\r\nEventually the day will come where we will obtain the elusive and mysterious Crystal, allowing us to escape from our Sky Island and into pocket dimensions of our own creation, full of resources and incredible creatures.\r\n\r\nRotary Skies is a proud affiliate of Akliz Server Hosting!

Our modpack strives to provide a harmonious blend of technology-focused mods and a reimagining of Minecraft's default biomes, rendering world generation more captivating and varied than ever.\r\n\r\nBeyond the revitalized world generation, we've incorporated remarkable mods by YUNGNICKYOUNG, the mastermind behind Better Dungeons and other structure-enhancing modifications designed to enrich the vanilla experience. These mods introduce automation, technological advancements, and further exploration opportunities, especially within the enigmatic Twilight Forest.\r\n\r\nTo ensure a seamless All The Forge experience, we recommend running the modpack with a minimum of 5GB of RAM.

In such a case, the version of Fabric currently included in the modpack is 0.16.7\r\n\r\nOptiFine: By default, OptiFine is not compatible with All The Fabric 5 because it contains some pre-installed optimization mods. Therefore, you must remove the listed mods below in order to load the pack with OptiFine.\r\n\r\n+ Sodium\r\n+ Lithium\r\n+ Indium\r\n+ Iris Shaders\r\n+ ImmediatelyFast\r\n+ Cull Less Leaves\r\n+ CIT Resewn\r\n+ Custom Entity Models\r\n+ Entity Texture Features\r\n+ Entity Culling\r\n\r\nPlease remember that in addition to OptiFine, you must also have a mod called OptiFabric installed, otherwise the pack will crash. We do not recommend using OptiFine at all due to its closed source and mod incompatibility. You can download OptiFabric from https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/optifabric if you still want to use OptiFine.\r\n\r\n\r\n OPTIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS\r\n\r\nIf your system can handle it, I suggest trying out some shaders with this modpack and Minecraft to enhance your experience. Shaders can bring out the best in both the modpack and the game.","discordInviteURL":"https://discord.ampznetwork.com","supportURL":"https://github.com/AMPZNetwork/All-The-Fabric","websiteURL":"https://www.ampznetwork.com"},{"id":599,"position":132,"name":"SkyFactory 5","type":"public","devVersions":[],"versions":[],"createServer":true,"logging":true,"featured":false,"hasDiscordImage":false,"description":null}]
